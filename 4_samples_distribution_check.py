# This script will output the total number of labels for each class of interest, providing the user with information regarding the data distribution for each class on which predictions will be made. 
## Adjust the label_counts category by adding or removing the # of behavioural classes in your project. There were five behaviours of interest in our study; thus, we start with a count of zero for classes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
### Refer to the associated article (Chen et al., 2025) and Supplemental Table 1 for descriptions of each script's intended usage and parameters.
