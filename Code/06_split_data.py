# There are many methods to separate datasets into training and test splits (e.g., nested k-fold cross validation). We provide a simple method to introductory users that conducts an 80:20 split. However, it is important also to test model performance on a holdout dataset that has not been seen during the training stage. 
## Refer to the associated article (Chen et al., 2025) and Supplemental Table 1 for descriptions of each script's intended usage and parameters.
