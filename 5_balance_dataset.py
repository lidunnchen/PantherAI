# It is often times important to balance your dataset so that the model does not become biased during training. The number of samples (images and associated labels) should be approximtely the same across behavioural classes of interest. 
## Adust the "class_counts" argument below to reflect the total number of samples in each group. This information is important to provide in the script so that we can properly adjust/balance the dataset.
### If you are not sure of how many sample labels there are for each behaviour, you can apply the included script, "samples_distribution_check.py" to determine that information. 
### Refer to the associated article (Chen et al., 2025) and Supplemental Table 1 for descriptions of each script's intended usage and parameters.
